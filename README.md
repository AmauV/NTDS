# NTDS


Flight route project.

This project needs two additional librairies:
- geopy to compute geodesic distances,
- folium to plot the world map.

There are two notebooks:
- pre-computation.ipynb computes the adjacency and weighted matrices from the data,
- Projecy.ipynb is the display of our work, shown in progressive manner.

Warning: Google Chrome does not support folium. Please use Firefox or Safari instead.
